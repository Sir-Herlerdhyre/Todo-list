# 📝 React To-Do List App

This is a simple and clean To-Do List app built with React.js and styled using CSS. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them. The app was created as part of my front-end development learning journey to practice working with React states, user input, and conditional rendering.


## 🚀 Features

 ✅ Add new tasks easily
 ✔️ Mark tasks as completed
 ❌ Delete tasks with one click
 📱 Responsive design (works on mobile & desktop)
 💚 Styled with pure CSS, no libraries used

## 🛠️ Built With

 React.js (useState hook)
 HTML & CSS (no frameworks)
 Functional Components
 Clean, minimalistic UI

## ✨ What I Learned

 Managing React state using `useState`
 Writing clean conditional logic for toggling UI
 Improving UI/UX with CSS transitions and responsive design
 Practicing modular component structure in React

## 📦 Getting Started

Clone the repo and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-todo-list.git
cd react-todo-list
npm install
npm start
```
